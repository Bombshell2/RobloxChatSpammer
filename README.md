# RobloxChatSpammer
Python script that auto spams a txt file into chat. Self explanatory.
## Limitations
Cant press keyboard while typing in chat, only during the one second window between messages. Click to move is reccomended.

Cant press left click while typing.
## How to use
First run 'py -3 setup.py' to install libraries.

Then run 'py -3 main.py' and select a file in the files directory

After x seconds (changeable in config.json, default 7.5), it will start typing in Roblox (make sure Roblox is the focused window!).

Throw mouse into corner to stop typing, press pause key (default "|") to well, pause.
