Hawaiian pizza is a pizza originating in Canada,[1][2][3][4][5][6] and is traditionally topped with pineapple, tomato sauce, cheese, and either ham or bacon. In 2014, Time listed Hawaiian pizza first on its list of "The 13 Most Influential Pizzas of All Time".[17][18] Opinions towards Hawaiian pizza are generally divisive and polarizing. Although many enjoy the taste, others vehemently dislike it, possibly due to the sweetness of pineapple paired with "salty pizza ingredients."[19][20] In 2017, Icelandic president Guðni Th. Jóhannesson reportedly told a group of high school students during a Q&A that he was fundamentally opposed to putting pineapple on pizza. He jokingly added that he would ban pineapple as a pizza topping if he could, as long as he received 30% of the under 21 vote. His off-the-cuff remark generated a flurry of media coverage and inspired many, regardless of their taste for Hawaiian pizza, to express their opinions on social media. Celebrities shared their liking or distaste for Hawaiian pizza,[21][22][23][24] including Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, who expressed support for it by tweeting: “I have a pineapple. I have a pizza. And I stand behind this delicious Southwestern Ontario creation."[25][26] Panopoulos, at that point retired from the restaurant business, was called upon by some media outlets to defend his creation.[10][27] Guðni later clarified that he was only joking, and that he did not have the power to ban particular toppings on pizza; he added that even he would not like to live in a country where the leader could ban anything that they did not like.[28] American author John Green reflected on the dish's cosmopolitan origins and reach, noting its Canadian invention by a Greek immigrant, inspired by Chinese cuisine to put a South American fruit on an Italian dish, which has gained its greatest popularity in Australia.[29] From Wikipedia, the Free encyclopedia.
